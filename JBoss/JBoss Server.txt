Web Server - JBoss Wildfly:-
---------------------------
-> What is JBoss?
  ->JBoss is a powerful open source application server developed by Redhat.

Website:  
wildfly.org/downloads/   (current version is 35.0.0.Final)-->(Wildfly Distribution- zip file)

-> We have two port numbers in JBoss:-     ->9990--->Admin
					   ->8080--->Applications/Artifacts

Admin:<URL:9990>
<URL:8080>/<application_Name>

-> Folder Structure of the Wildfly:-
   -------------------------------
->Domain
->Modules
->Welcome-content
->docs
->bin
->appclient

->To start the JBoss wildfly:
  ->Go to home folder of the wildfly, then go to 'bin'
  ->Click on the file 'Standalone'(Windows Batch File)

->How to shutdown the JBoss wildfly:
  -> One way is to close the black window where the 'standalone' is running.

->How to create Management Console User Creation:-
  ----------------------------------------------
-><Home folder of wildfly ---->bin
->file name: add-user(Windows batch file)
->Once you double-click on add-user:- It will ask you the following questions?
->What type of user do you wish to add?
  a)Management User(mgmt-users.properties)
  b)Application User(application-user.properties)
->By clicking any option it will show to create user with new login credentials.

-->How to access the wildfly:-
   -------------------------
->Admin/Management console: <URL:9990>
--> Give User Name & Password to login and to launch the wildfly webserver.
->One of the folder structure is 'Standalone' where we will be having the configuration and deployment and logs.
 --->Standalone--->Configuration, Deployment, logs.

->Configuration: Where we will be having configurations of applications, users specifics.
Eg: mgmt-users.properties & mgmt-groups.properties
->Logs:Standalone-->log-->logs of the wildfly
->Deployments: A deployment represents anything that can be deployed.
(Eg:-An application such as EJB-JAR, WAR, EAR any kind of standard archieve such as RAR or JBoss-specific deployment) into a server.

->You can use drag and drop to add new content or replace existing deployments. Simply drag one or several files onto the deployment column. If there's already a deployment with the same name, the deployment will be replaced, otherwise the deployment will be added. The deployment added by drag and drop will be enabled by default.

->In the left pane page, there will be three options under deployments:-
1. Upload Deployment
2. Unmanaged Deployment
3. Create Empty Deployment

->How to deploy the application (or) artifacts:-
  --------------------------------------------
One way: Copying the war file and pasting it deployment folder of wildfly (Home of wildfly-->Standalone-->Deployments)
-------
Another way:- cp<artifact source path> <destination of deployments of wildfly>
-----------
Another way:- JBoss wildfly GUI--> Upload artifact

Configuration:
-------------
->Things to keep in mind before changing configurational changes:-
  ->Where to change 
  ->Backup
  ->How to change
  ->Try or experiment in local environments
  ->Documentation
 
Snapshot/Backup:-
---------------
->For wildfly-->configuration snapshot
->Home folder of wildfly-->standalone-->configuration-->standalone_xml_history
->filename: standalone.v1
  Eg: port number change
      standalone-port change.v2
->Need to rename the original or existed file and then replace the customized as per requirement/change.

Different status of the artifacts deployed in wildfly:-
------------------------------------------------------
-> In wildfly, deployed artifacts can have various status states including:
  ->Deployed: The application is successfully running on wildfly server and accessible to users.
  ->Undeployed: The application has been removed from the server and is not currently running.
  ->Failed: The deployment process encountered an error and the application is not running.
  ->Disabled: The application is intentionally stopped by the administrator and cannot be accessed until enabled.
  ->Suspended: The application is temporarily paused and can be resumed later.
  ->Redeploying: The application is currently being updated with new code and is not fully available while the redeployment process is ongoing.

Accessing deployment Status:-
---------------------------
Wildfly Management Console:-
--------------------------
->You can view the status of deployed artifacts through the wildfly admin console, which provides a list of deployments with their current state.

CLI (Command Line Interface):
----------------------------
->Using the wildfly command-line interface, you can query the status of deployments with management commands.
->Indicating whether the application is currently running, not deployed, encountered an error during deployment, intentionally deactivated, temporarily paused, or is in the process of being re-deployed with updates.


->Domain & Host Controller in wildfly:
  -----------------------------------
->In JBoss wildfly, a "domain controller" is the central management point for a group of servers within a domain, responsible for maintaining the overall configuration and policy,
-->While a "host controller" is a separate process running on each server within the domain, communicating with the domain controller to manage the individual server instances on that host machine.
-->Essentially, the domain controller dictates the overall configuration, and the host controllers execute those configurations on their respective servers.

-> Key points about domain and host controllers:-
   --------------------------------------------
  ->Domain Controller:-
    -----------------
 ->Acts as the central management point for the entire domain.
 ->Stores the domain-wide configuration in a file called "domain.xml"
   (Home folder-->Domain-->Configuration-->domain.xml)
 ->Responsible for distributing configuration changes to all host controllers within the domain.

  ->Host Controller:-
    ---------------
 ->Manages the application server instances running on a specific host.
 ->Reads its configuration from a "host.xml" file specific to that host.
   (Home folder-->Domain-->Configuration-->host.xml)
 ->Communicates with the domain controller to receive configuration updates and start/stop the server instances.

-->Domain is referring to master and centralized where we can manage other(host) wildfly servers.
