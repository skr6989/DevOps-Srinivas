1. What if webhooks in Git? What is the purpose? Why we use it?

Def:
 A Webhook in Git is a way to trigger automatic actions or notifications when specific events occur in a git repository. 
	Eg: Push, pull request
Purpose:
-> To automate workflows and integrate with external services.
->To send real-time notifications of repository events.

Use:
->Automation: Trigger tasks like CI/CD pipelines, tests, or deployments automatically.

->Real-time updates: Instant notifications for events like code changes or issues.

->Integration: Connect Git with external tools (Eg: Slack, Jira, Deployment Services)

->Efficiency: Save time by reducing manual intervention in workflows.


2. What is API?

 API (Application Programming Interface): 
      ----------------------------------
An API is a set of rules and protocols that allow one software application to interact with another. It defines the methods and formats for communication.

Purpose:
-> To enable software systems to communicate with each other.

-> To provide a standardized way for developers to access services or data.

--> Where we use API:
    -----------------
 -> Web development
 -> Mobile Apps
 -> Third-party Integrations
 
--> Why we use API:
    --------------
-> Enables System communication
-> Automates Process
-> Integrate services
-> Save development time
-> Increase Flexibility



3. What is TDD and BDD?

TDD - Test-Driven Development

Definition: Write tests before writing the actual code.

Process: Write a test--> Run the test (it will fail initially)--> Write just enough code to pass the test--> Refactor code

Jenkins Role: Automates unit test (Eg: JUnit) as part of CI/CD pipeline, providing continuous feedback on code quality.

Advantage: Early bug detection and high code quality.


BDD - Behaviour-Driven Development

Definition: Write test in natural language using Given-When-Then scenarios, focusing on business behaviour.

Process: 
-> Define behaviour in natural language
-> Write automated tests for those behaviours

Jenkins Role: Runs BDD scenarios using tools like cucumber, reports human-readable test results.

Advantage:
-> Improved collaboration with non-technical stakeholders, ensuring software meets business requirements.

-> Both methods helps automate testing in Jenkins, improving code quality and ensuring continuous validation.
