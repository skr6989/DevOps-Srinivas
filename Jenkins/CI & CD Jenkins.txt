Introduction to Jenkins:
-----------------------
Features of Jenkins:
-------------------
->Easy Installation process
->Upgrades are easily available
->Provides advance security
->Lightweight container support
->Optimized performance
->Distributed Team Management

-> What is Continuous Integration:-
  ------------------------------
 ->It is the process of automating the building and testing of code, each time one of the team member commits changes to version control.

->CI- Continuous Integration
->CD- Continuous Delivery (release) & Continuous Deployment as well

Popular Continuous Integration Tools:
------------------------------------
-> Gitlab CI
-> Jenkins
-> Codeship
-> Teamcity
-> Bamboo
-> Travis CI

-> From AWS Cloud, if we watched to perform CI & CD, there are various services like codecommit, code deploy, codeguru, codebuild, and codepipeline.

-> From Azure cloud, we have Azure devops, Azure boards, Azure repos, Azure pipelines, Azure Test plans and Azure artifacts.



->What is Jenkins?
  ----------------
  -> A continuous Integration server which manages and control processes such as plan, code, build, test, deploy, operate and monitor in DevOps Environment.
    ->Plan  ->Code  ->Build  ->Test  ->Deploy   ->Operate   ->Monitor

->Continuous integration is also known as "Automation Server"

->Why Jenkins is So popular:-
  -------------------------
->Open Source
->Good plug-in support
->Good community support
->Fast and Reliable
->Good OS Support
->Scripted Builds

Topics:-
------
->Following are the topics will be covered in this module:-
  -------------------------------------------------------
-> Jenkins Architecture
-> Plug-in Management in Jenkins
-> Jenkins Security Management
-> Notifications in Jenkins
-> Jenkins Master Slave Architecture
-> Jenkins Delivery Pipeline
-> Jenkins Declarative Pipeline

Jenkins Architecture:
---------------------
Git--->Jenkins
	  |											 |----> Test Environment
	  |											 |
	  |											 |
	  |										         |----->Release Environment
Build + Unit Test --> Function Test ---> Deploy---> Is branch test, release or production -----> |
												 |
												 |------>Production Environment

Plug-ins:-
---------
-> To have the extra functionality we are using plug-ins.


Plug-in Management in Jenkins:-
-----------------------------


	  |--Update-->Shows updates to plug-ins already installed
	  |--Available-->Shows plug-ins that are available for installation
Tabs------|--Installed-->Displays plug-ins installed that have no updates
	  |--Advanced-->Lists configuration of HTTP Proxy, allows manual upload of plug-ins and URL of plug-in site


->In real-time, we cannot install the plug-ins as simple as that reason being "there might be challenges with proxy settings as well as VPN". In order to avoid this, we should configure HTTP Proxy in Jenkins plug-ins of Advanced Tag.

-> How to Install Jenkins on Windows:-

		[http://localhost:[portnumber]]

	Eg: http://localhost:8080 (or) 127.0.0.1:8080

-> Navigate to the location on your system specified by the unblock Jenkins page.

-> Please copy the password from location-

	[C:\ProgramData\Jenkins\.jenkins\secret\initialAdminPassword] where initialAdminPassword is a file.

-> In order to read the data of that file use 'cat' command.

	[cat C:\ProgramData\Jenkins\.jenkins\secret\initialAdminPassword]

-> Copy the password from the initialAdminPassword file which is alphanumeric.

-> Paste the password in the Administrator password field on the unblock Jenkins page and click continue to proceed.

-> After clicking on continue, once you unlock Jenkins, customize and prepare the Jenkins environment.

-> Click the install suggested plug-ins button to have Jenkins automatically install the most frequently used plug-ins.

-> After Jenkins finishes installing the plug-ins, enter the required information on the Create First Admin User page. Click save and continue to proceed.

	[Create First Admin User--> Username--> Password--> Confirm Password--> Full name--> Email address--> Save and Continue]

->Then save and finish to finish the initial customization.


--> How to Stop Jenkins server on Windows:
    -------------------------------------
-> Go to the services in windows local system.
-> Search for J-(Jenkins)
-> Stop the server.

--> How to restart the Jenkins:-
    --------------------------
-> One way:- (safeRestart)
   -------  
-> Go to URL of the Jenkins and type (http://localhost:8080/safeRestart)

-> safeRestart:- Jenkins will try to pause jobs and restart once all running jobs are either finished or paused.

-> (Message page)-> Jenkins is restarting banner.

-> This will be displayed on most Jenkins pages, you can use it to let users know what is happening. A default message will be added if you don't supply one.

Plug-in Installation
--------------------:
 ->There are two ways to install Plug-ins:
   --------------------------------------
->Automatically   ->Manually

Automatically:
-------------
->Once we login to Jenkins GUI, left side you will see the option of manage Jenkins.

->Click on Manage Jenkins, in first tab there is system configuration under that we can see plug-ins.

->Click on plug-ins go to available plug-ins and search for the plug-in which is required.

->Select the plug-in under the list once you select the plug-in install button will be highlighted, then click on install button.

Manually:
--------
->Under plug-ins tab, go for available plug-ins and search for the plug-in, click on the plug-in which is required.

->Once you click on the plug-in new tab will be opened, then click on releases and under releases you can see various versions of the plug-ins.

->Go for the plug-ins which is required specific version.

->Click on 'direct link' in installation options, once you click on Direct link plug-in will get downloaded to our local machine.

->When we download plug-in in manual way again we need to deploy it to Jenkins.

->In Jenkins GUI plug-ins tab, Click on advanced settings.

->Choose the file to upload which is downloaded to local machine.


--> Plug-ins:-
    -------- 
-> It is about to add, remove, disable or enable plug-ins that can extend the functionality of Jenkins.

-> When we install plug-in in automatic way, plug-ins extension is .jpi (Jenkins Plug-in) when we install in automatic way.

-> When we install plug-in in manual way, plug-ins extension is hpi (Hudson plug-in).


-> How to uninstall the plug-ins:
   -----------------------------
  ->Manage Jenkins--> Plug-ins-->Installed plug-ins-->search plug-in and then uninstall button will be highlighted. Once clicked on uninstall, plug-in will get uninstalled.

-> How to Update the Plug-in:
   -------------------------
-> Manage Jenkins--> Plug-ins--> Updates

->Select the plug-in and then update button will be highlighted. Once clicked on update, plug-in will get updated.

->In real-time, we should not update the plug-ins directly. Reason being there may be challenges will be encountered.

->It will be recommended the plug-in to update in local machine where other team members will not get affected if anything goes wrong.


-> How to Create the Users in Jenkins:-
  ------------------------------------
  -> Login to admin console.
  -> Go to security, before that go to users (create/delete/modify users that can create Jenkins)
  ->Click on Users--> create user-->Credentials (custom)
  ->Username-->Password-->Confirm Password-->Full name--> Email Address-->Create

-> How to give permissions to the User:-
   -----------------------------------

-> Manage Jenkins--> Security (Secure Jenkins, define who is allowed to access/use the system)

-> In Authorization path, add user button, will be asked user ID give the User ID click on OK button.

-> Then give the required permission to the user by checking the box. (The minimum access to give is overall read).

-> By default whatever we create users for Jenkins will stored in "Jenkins own user database". This is suitable for smaller setup where you have no existing user database elsewhere.

-> The other option is "LDAP" (Light weight Directory Access Protocol)


-> Authorization Strategies:-
  --------------------------
->By default, we will be seeing "Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy".

->With this we can the authorization, based on the option available under this strategy.
  Ex:- Overall, credentials, Agent, Job, Run, view etc.,

-> Matrix Authorization Strategy:-
   -----------------------------

  -> It allows configuring the lowest level permissions, such as starting new builds, configuring items, or deleting them individually.


-> Jenkins Project ( Project (or) Job):-
   ---------------- 
 -> It is a combination of one or more tasks.

1. Free Style Project:-
   -------------------
       -> Classic, generate purpose job type that checks out from up to one SCM, executes build steps serially, followed by post-build steps like archiving artifacts and sending email notifications.

2. Maven Project:
   --------------
       -> Build a maven project, Jenkins takes advantage of your POM files and drastically reduces the configuration.

3. Pipeline:
   --------
       -> Orchestrates long-running activities that can span multiple build agents, suitable for building pipelines (formerly known as workflows) and/or organizing complex activities that do not easily fit in free-style job type.

4. Multi-configuration project:
   ----------------------------
       -> Suitable for projects that need a large number of different configurations, such as testing on multiple environments, platform-specific builds, etc.,

5. Folder:
   ------
       -> Creates a container that stores nested items in it. Useful for grouping things together. Unlike view, which is just a filter, a folder creates a separate namespace, so you can have multiple things of the same name as long as they are in different folders.

6. Multibranch pipeline: 
   --------------------
       -> Creates a set of pipeline projects according to detected branches in one SCM repository.

7. Organization folder:
   -------------------
       -> Creates a set of multibranch project subfolders by scanning for repositories.


-> How to Create the Job (or) Project:
   -----------------------------------
  -> In Jenkins GUI, you can see in left pane side 'New item' click on it and "enter an item name".

  -> Then select an item type, once after selecting any item click on OK button.

  -> The job configuration is consist of General (where we can give information (or) description about the project), then in source code management where we will be passing URL's of the repositories, next to that build triggers (In what way we want to trigger (or) build that job).

  -> Build environment, build steps(where we can  add tasks), post-build actions.


-> How to create a free-style basic Job:
   -------------------------------------
  -> New item--> Give the Job name--> Select item type--> Go to the build steps (configuration of the job)--> add build step dropdown--> select execute windows batch command--> type dir --> Click on save

  -> Then Click on build now & check for console output.
